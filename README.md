# CAPM

The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a foundational model in finance that describes the relationship between the expected return of an asset and its risk, as measured by its sensitivity to market movements. CAPM is used to estimate the required rate of return for an asset, given its risk relative to the market.


Expected Return (E(R_i)): The expected return of an asset is the return that investors anticipate receiving over a period, given the asset's risk profile.

Risk-Free Rate (R_f): The risk-free rate is the return on an investment with zero risk, typically represented by government bonds like U.S. Treasury bills.

Market Return (E(R_m)): The market return is the expected return of the market portfolio, which represents all risky assets in the market.

Beta (β_i): Beta is a measure of an asset's volatility or systematic risk relative to the market. It indicates how much the asset's return is expected to change in response to a change in the market return.
β_i = Cov(R_i, R_m) / Var(R_m)
Where:
Cov(R_i, R_m) is the covariance between the returns of asset i and the market returns.
Var(R_m) is the variance of the market returns.

Market Risk Premium (E(R_m) - R_f): The market risk premium is the excess return that investors require for holding a risky market portfolio instead of risk-free assets.
Market Risk Premium = E(R_m) - R_f



The CAPM formula expresses the expected return of an asset as a function of the risk-free rate, the asset's beta, and the market risk premium:
E(R_i) = R_f + β_i * (E(R_m) - R_f)
Where:
E(R_i) is the expected return of asset i.
R_f is the risk-free rate.
β_i is the beta of asset i.
E(R_m) is the expected return of the market.
E(R_m) - R_f is the market risk premium.

Beta (β_i):
If β_i > 1: The asset is more volatile than the market, meaning it is expected to have greater returns (or losses) than the market in response to market movements.
If β_i < 1: The asset is less volatile than the market, meaning it is expected to have smaller returns (or losses) than the market in response to market movements.
If β_i = 1: The asset's return is expected to move in line with the market.
Security Market Line (SML): The SML is a graphical representation of the CAPM. It plots the expected return of an asset against its beta, showing the relationship between risk and return. The slope of the SML is the market risk premium.

Assets above the SML are considered undervalued because they offer a higher return for their level of risk.
Assets below the SML are considered overvalued because they offer a lower return for their level of risk.
